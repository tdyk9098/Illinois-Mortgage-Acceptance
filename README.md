# Illinois-Mortgage-Acceptance

# Abstract

The objective of this project is to provide an independent study on the relationships between various factors of a property, mortgage application, and mortgage applicant to determine trends for successful home ownership in Illinois.

Every year, the  Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council requires institutions to report mortgage loan application and property data for a report mandated through the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. 

As property costs continue to rise faster than wages, home-ownership seems more like an American dream than an investment or a choice made with preferences.

To understand the factors of successful mortgage applications, the report uses natural language preprocessing, feature engineering,clustering, statistical analysis, and machine learning applications to develop significant conclusions and relationships between selected features.

The goal of the study is to provide insights into correlated factors with successful mortgage applicants in Illinois. This is done through interpreting various features on the 2021 HDMA report, feature engineering fields, and analyzing stratas to determine statistically significant relationships.
